# PROJECT PRESENTATION
Hi there! My name is Wallace Baldenebre, and I hope you enjoy this project that I made with <3

## FIRST OF ALL...
A developer does should not live by code alone... So this is the why that I decide to create
the ui too for this project. I had some opportunities to act like UI/UX in some projects,
so for me to use the Adobe XD and Illustrator for me is awesome!

The link to see the screens(just a prototype to create the idea): https://marvelapp.com/prototype/109j56f7

## TO RUN THE PROJECT...
There is no secret. Just clone the project and run it

## ARCHITECTURE USED
MVVM with Koin as DI

## DEPENDENCIES
External dependencies: Koin, MockK
Others dependencies: Google Libraries or correlated

## ...HOW ABOUT UNIT TEST?
Yes! We have Unit Test, I did a case for example

## Screens
How the ideia was to see a scalable project, I decide to implement more than 2 screens
- Splash: just a transition to the main page
- Events: the main page, where the user can see the events. Is possible the user to touch on the Buy button of the event and be redirected to the details. Or touch on Please notes to see the details of the event
- Use the search bar to filter the events
- EventDetails: the details of the event, where the user can touch on the button to Buy, and be redirected to the browser
